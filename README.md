- **CYPHERON** is an android mobile application, purely implemented in `JAVA` and `XML` from scratch. It is developed for people who intend to hide/secure their data from unwanted guests by encrypting the text data through a variety of `cipher algorithms`.
- It uses some of the basic cipher algorithm techniques to `encrypt` or `decrypt` the text data. Many users can learn &amp; understand the working of some basic ciphers as well as the importance of data security.

## Objective & Scope of the Project :
This software is a time saver providing few pre-constructed ciphers on a simple easy to use interface. The user is provided a choice to select a suitable cipher by selecting from the list. The interface is clean and simple for easy use. The user can enter the message, select a cipher and generate the related code message from the home screen itself.
- To help the user encrypt a message before sending it.
- To help the user decrypt a coded message sent by the other user.
- To help save time by providing pre-constructed ciphers and avoiding encrypting/decrypting a message manually.

## Future Scope :

- More advanced cryptographic algorithms can be used.
- Image cryptography (Steganography) can be used for a different type of encryption.
- More options to customize the application can be implemented.
- The application can be used as a floating software rather than opening the whole application.
